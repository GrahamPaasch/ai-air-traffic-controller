# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major milestones for developing the AI-based air traffic controller system. It is divided into three broad phases with incremental deliverables.

## Phase 1: Research and Requirements
- **Gather FAA Regulations**: Compile all relevant guidelines, standards, and compliance requirements.
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Talk with aviation experts, pilots, and current controllers to define critical needs.
- **Technology Assessment**: Evaluate AI frameworks, simulation tools, and data sources.
- **Feasibility Study**: Determine the scope and key challenges of automating air traffic control tasks.

## Phase 2: Prototype Development
- **System Architecture**: Design the core modules, including communication, optimization, monitoring, and safety agents.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Build a minimal prototype to handle simple traffic scenarios.
- **Simulation Testing**: Create stress tests to validate algorithms in various conditions.
- **Iterative Feedback**: Incorporate feedback from experts and refine the prototype.

## Phase 3: Full Implementation and Deployment
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Expand to handle national-level traffic volumes.
- **Compliance Review**: Ensure the system meets or exceeds all FAA requirements.
- **Pilot Programs**: Deploy in limited airspace regions for real-world testing.
- **Training & Documentation**: Provide training materials and system documentation for operators.
- **Rollout & Maintenance**: Gradually expand deployment while maintaining regular updates and monitoring.

This roadmap is intended as a living document. As the project evolves, tasks may be added or adjusted to best meet the goals of creating a reliable AI air traffic control system.
