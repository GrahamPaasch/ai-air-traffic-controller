# ai-air-traffic-controller
The US is experiencing a shortage of around 3000 air traffic controllers leading to significant delays and safety concerns. This repository aims to solve this gap by enhancing air traffic management by automating critical tasks, reducing workloads on human controllers, and ensuring safer more efficient airspace operations.

The optimal result of this project would be a complete AI agent that can fully replace the missing 3000 workers, ideally with development, testing, and deployment taking far less time than it takes to train a new human air traffic controller.

For an overview of upcoming milestones and deployment goals, see the [project roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
