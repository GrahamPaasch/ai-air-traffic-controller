# Feasibility Study

This document summarizes the scope and key challenges of automating air traffic control (ATC) tasks. It is intended to guide further research and development as outlined in the project [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Scope of Automation
- **Routine Communication**: Automating standard exchanges between aircraft and controllers to reduce human workload while keeping humans in the loop for complex situations.
- **Traffic Optimization**: Utilizing AI to propose and adjust flight paths for improved efficiency, fuel savings, and reduced congestion.
- **Conflict Detection**: Monitoring aircraft positions and predicting potential conflicts in real time.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring that all automated decisions adhere to FAA regulations and standard operating procedures.
- **System Monitoring**: Continuously tracking the health of automation systems and triggering alerts for anomalies.

## Key Challenges
- **Safety Assurance**: Proving that automated decisions meet or exceed the reliability of experienced controllers.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Handling high-volume data streams and maintaining low latency for critical decisions.
- **Human Factors**: Designing interfaces that allow seamless collaboration between AI systems and human controllers, especially in edge cases.
- **Regulatory Approval**: Navigating the certification process for AI-driven ATC functions, which may involve extensive testing and documentation.
- **Scalability**: Building infrastructure capable of nationwide deployment while remaining resilient to failures.

While many tasks can be assisted or partially automated, a hybrid approach combining AI with human oversight is likely in early deployments. Further research and simulation will help refine these assumptions and prioritize development efforts.
